Customizable cheat sheets written in markdown for 
use with pandoc, that generate HTML versions of them.

Included are a CoffeScript Cheat Sheet based on a 
PDF from this website:   
http://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/CoffeeScript%20Quick%20Ref.pdf   

There is a git cheat sheet based on these web sites:   
http://www.cheatography.com/samcollett/cheat-sheets/git/   
https://github.com/AlexZeitler/gitcheatsheet   
and http://www.git-tower.com/files/cheatsheet/Git_Cheat_Sheet_grey.pdf   

plus links to various other cheat sheets.  

Goal is to evolve these and make them hierarchical and personalizable :)
